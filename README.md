# AI Programming with Python Project (Flower Image Classifier)

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project,I've built and trained a deep neural network on the flower data set, converting it into an application that others can use. It consists of a pair of Python scripts (Train.py and Predict.py) that run from the command line. For testing, you should use the checkpoint you saved in the training part.
